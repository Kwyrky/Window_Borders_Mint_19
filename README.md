# Window Borders Mint19
Additional Metacity Themes from Mint 18.3 Cinnamon Edition tweaked to work in Mint 19 / Cinnamon 3.8.x

## Introduction

Just installed or upgraded to Mint 19 Cinnamon and wondering where all the Window Border theming options have gone? Missing your Ageing Gorilla, Crux, Esco etc...?

Never fear this repository contains the full set of 'missing' Window Border themes. Where necessary they have been updated to `metacity-theme-3.xml` formats to display correctly in the Cinnamon 3.8.x Themes module. Display issues have been fixed and compatibility for displaying colours from GTK3.22 themes has been improved.

Please be aware my testing of these modified themes has been fairly limited. Feedback with screenshots of any issues is very welcome.


## Installation

Open a terminal (ctrl t) and enter the following commands

* `wget https://github.com/smurphos/Window_Borders_Mint_19/releases/download/v.0.7/metacity_for_mint19_cinn.zip`

* `unzip -o metacity_for_mint19_cinn.zip -d ~/.themes`

* `rm metacity_for_mint19_cinn.zip`

Open the Themes app and the new Window Border's themes should be available for selection.
